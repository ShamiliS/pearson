Q: The web page has 3 distinct sections (Section1, Section2 and Section3), the levels are only 2
(published and hidden) and an array type = L4(23) how do you effectively write test cases
which will have high coverage?

No of Factors = 3 (Section1, Section2 and Section3)
No of Levels = 2 (published and hidden)
Array Type = L4(23)

1. Columns with the No. of factors
Testcase 	Section1	Section2	Section3

2. Enter the number of rows is equal to levels per factor. insert 3 rows for each level for section
TestCases	    Section1	    Section2	    Section3
Test_1
Test_2
Test_3
Test_4

3. Now split up the values in each levels

TestCases	    Section1	    Section2	    Section3
Test_1	      Published	    Published	    Published
Test_2	      Published	    Hidden	      Hidden
Test_3	      Hidden	      Published	    Hidden
Test_4	      Hidden	      Hidden	      Published
